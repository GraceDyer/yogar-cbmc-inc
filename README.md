# Running Environment

## I. Experimental Platform
Our experiments are conducted on a high-performance system with the following specifications:
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **Python Version**: 3.12
## II. Project Directory Description


### 1. Benchmarks
- **EX1**:
  - **bench-origin**: The original benchmark of experiment 1.
  - **bench-regression**: The regression benchmark manually modified.
  
- **EX2**:
  - **bench-origin**: The original benchmark of experiment 2.
  - **bench-regression**: The regression benchmark generated by an LLM from `bench-origin`.


### 2. Bin
The directory containing the executable binaries of our tool, including:
- **`yogar-CBMC`**: The non-regression version.
- **`yogar-CBMC-Inc`**: The regression version.

### 3. Scripts
Python scripts used in our experiments:
- **EX1-batch-run-yogar-cbmc-inc.py**: Executes regression verification of experiment 1 `bench-regression` in the EX1 folder.
- **EX1-batch-run-yogar-cbmc.py**: Executes non-regression verification of experiment 1  `bench-regression` in the EX1 folder.
- **EX2-batch-run-yogar-cbmc-inc.py**: Executes regression verification of experiment 1 `bench-regression` in the EX2 folder.
- **EX2-batch-run-yogar-cbmc.py**: Executes non-regression verification of experiment 1  `bench-regression` in the EX2 folder.
- **EX2-prompt.txt**: Contains the prompt used to generate `bench-regression` in the EX2 folder using a large language model.


### 4. Results
Contains the experimental data obtained from running `EX1-batch-run-incre.py`, `EX2-batch-run-incre.py`, `EX1-batch-run-non-incre.py` and `EX2-batch-run-non-incre.py`.

### 5. README.md
This file provides an overview of the project structure and instructions.

# Instructions for Reproducing Experimental Data

To reproduce the experimental data, follow these steps to perform regression and non-regression verifications, as well as to generate benchmark instances.

- **Execute Non-Regression Verification of Experiment 1**  
  Run the following to perform non-regression verification:
  ```bash
  python EX1-batch-run-non-incre.py
  ```
  This script verifies all instances in `bench-regression` sequentially using `yogar-CBMC`, with results recorded in `result-non-regression.txt`.

- **Generate Benchmarks for Regression Verification of Experiment 1**  
  To create the `bench-regression` benchmark instances from `bench-origin`, use:
  ```bash
  python EX1-batch-run-incre.py
  ```
  This script generates four versions of code for each instance, with `v0` representing the original instance. These instances facilitate comparison across incremental versions in regression verification.

# Explanation of Results

For each instance, the results include four key data points:

- **First Data Point**: Represents the number of kernel sources reused from previous versions.
- **Second Data Point**: Indicates the number of kernel sources generated in the current version.
- **Third Data Point**: Provides the verification result, which can be one of the following values:
  - `TRUE`: Verification succeeded
  - `FALSE`: Verification failed
  - `UNKNOWN`: Verification status could not be determined
  - `TIMEOUT`: Verification exceeded the allowed time
- **Fourth Data Point**: Specifies the time taken for the verification process in seconds.
