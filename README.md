# Architecture

## I. Experimental Platform
Our experiments are conducted on a high-performance system with the following specifications:
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **Python Version**: 3.12
## II. Project Directory Description

### 1. Benchmark
- **bench-origin**: The original benchmark extracted from SV-COMP 2024.
- **bench-regression**: The regression benchmark generated by an LLM from `bench-origin`.

### 2. Executable
The directory containing the executable binaries of our tool, including:
- **`yogar-CBMC`**: The non-regression version.
- **`yogar-CBMC-reg`**: The regression version.

### 3. Scripts
Python scripts used in our experiments:
- **regression-bench-generate.py**: Generates the regression benchmark from `bench-origin`.
- **batch-run-incre.py**: Performs regression verification on `bench-regression`.
- **batch-run-non-incre.py**: Performs non-regression verification on `bench-regression`.

### 4. Experiments
Contains the experimental data obtained from running `batch-run-incre.py` and `batch-run-non-incre.py`.

### 5. README.md
This file provides an overview of the project structure and instructions.
